- Semantic tags are used to "provide meaning to HTML sections and make the page more readable and accessible to people with disabilites. Semantic HTMl also creates standardization between development teams." - devbootcamp GPS 1.2:html. To me, main seems useful to declare what is the main content within a body tag, as well as article to denote major parts of your site. 

- Order browser uses to load elements: <html> -> <head> -> <body>, and top to bottom within those sections

- I learned how to use snippets, where to save them, and a handy shortcut to create comments in any file type (cmd forward slash). I think for now I will type everything out to cement muscle memory, and once I get more comfortable create snippets of code I use frequently.

- For me the hardest concept was understanding when specifically to use semantic tags. It seems like it is slightly up to the developer as long as it makes sense. I learned from my guide John that using div tags everywhere is bad practice, because if another developer decides to work on your page or if you come back to it later it will be hard to decipher what is what. It is better to use tags like article and section (for example an article could include sections for blog posts and questions/answers)
