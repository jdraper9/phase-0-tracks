1) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

	Input: 

		SELECT * FROM reviews
		JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
		JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

	Output:

		1|4|I got married!|1|2|2|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
		2|5|Best tow I ever got in my whole life|2|3|3|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing
		3|2|Drinks were too expensive|3|4|4|Angela|Jolie|3|The Beatle Nightclub


2) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

	Input:

		SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.Name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
		JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
		JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

	Output:

		Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|I got married!
		Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|5|Best tow I ever got in my whole life
		Angela|Jolie|The Beatle Nightclub|2|Drinks were too expensive

3) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
	
	Input:

		SELECT * FROM reviews
		JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
		JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
		WHERE reviews.business_id = 1;

	Output:

		1|4|I got married!|1|2|2|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
