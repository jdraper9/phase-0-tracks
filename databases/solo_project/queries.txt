SQL Queries:

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

	Input:
		SELECT * FROM media;
	Output:
		1|Pulp Fiction|5|true|1
		2|Twilight|2|false|1
		3|Game of Thrones|4|true|2
		4|Samurai Champloo|4|true|2


2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	Input:
		UPDATE media SET rating=5 WHERE name="Game of Thrones";
	Output:
		N/A

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

	Input:
		SELECT * FROM media, type WHERE media.type_id = type.id;
	Output:
		1|Pulp Fiction|5|true|1|1|Movie
		2|Twilight|2|false|1|1|Movie
		3|Game of Thrones|5|true|2|2|TV
		4|Samurai Champloo|4|true|2|2|TV

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

	Input:
		SELECT media.name, media.rating, type.media_type FROM media JOIN type ON media.type_id = type.id;
	Output:
		Pulp Fiction|5|Movie
		Twilight|2|Movie
		Game of Thrones|5|TV
		Samurai Champloo|4|TV


5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	Input:
		DELETE FROM media WHERE name="Twilight";
	Output:
		N/A;


Release 3. Try different JOIN commands - *these would be easier to destinguish if my tables were set up differently*

# Inner Join: (Shows intersection of matching values)
	Input: SELECT media.name, media.rating, type.media_type FROM media INNER JOIN type ON media.type_id = type.id;
	Output:
		Pulp Fiction|5|Movie
		Game of Thrones|5|TV
		Samurai Champloo|4|TV

# Left Join: (Shows all records from table A and all matching records in table B)
	Input: SELECT media.name, media.rewatchable, type.media_type FROM media LEFT JOIN type ON media.type_id = type.id;
	Output:
		Pulp Fiction|true|Movie
		Game of Thrones|true|TV
		Samurai Champloo|true|TV

# Right Join: (Shows all records from table B and all matching records in table A)
	Input: SELECT media.name, media.rating, type.media_type FROM media RIGHT JOIN type ON media.type_id = type.id;
	Output: Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported   # (?)

# Full Join: (shows all records from table A and B)
	Input: SELECT media.name, media.rating, type.media_type FROM media FULL JOIN type ON media.type_id = type.id;
	Output: Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported    # (?)
