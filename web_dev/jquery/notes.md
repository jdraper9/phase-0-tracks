#jQuery notes

1. Find out how to install/use jQuery
	* "jQuery isn't installed like a program, it's a file that needs to be included in your source code somehow, the most common practice is to include by adding <script type='text/javascript' language='javascript' src='local/path/to/jquery.js'></script> in the <head> section of your page."
	* or... "put this right above your closing body tag:
		<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/[jquery version here]/jquery.min.js" language="javascript" type="text/javascript"></script>   "
	* Way I'd like to try. Include 
		<script src="jquery.js"></script>
		<script src="script.js"></script>
	  .. before end of head tag

2. Look up jQuery tutorial
	* "From the jQuery web site: 'jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.'"

	* try onload function
		window.onload = function(){
			alert( "welcome");
		}

3. Look up cheat sheet, find commands you think will be useful. Try some out.
